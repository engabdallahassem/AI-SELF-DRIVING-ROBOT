# AI-SELF-DRIVING-ROBOT
Our robot is a self-driving car. The robot is powered by AI using HuskyLens. The robot stays on the right side of the wall. We’re using color recognition so that the robot can detect the green, red and blue blocks scattered around the map.
Our project can improve  the future of the way we do things. With the first small steps into this vision, we believe our project can simplify jobs and execute tasks without error.
